Go find someone and sing this song with them.", "All Too Well - (The 10 minute version of course). You like to be alone a lot, but you are independent and ambitious.

You're a very social person.", "Red - You are a very loveable person.", "Blank Space - You tend to scare people with your confidence, but in a good way.", "Shake It Off - You are a very silly person that everyone wants to be around.", "Wildest Dreams - You love to get lost in the clouds and think about the most random things. You live in the moment.", "Delicate - You can stress over how people view you, but what you don't realize is that they are jealous of you.", "ME! - You know yourself very very well. You know what you want in life.", "22 - You're not 21 but you're also not 23 ;)", "Paper Rings - You're very creative and able to think fast.", "Lover - You are a kind and caring person.", "Fifteen - You are the result of 3x5. :P"]
